  			<p class="growth"> 
  				🚀 I've helped over 50 smb, startup, and enterprise companies grow. 
          <br>
          The world of digital marketing swept me away in 2016 when I started a Shopify store. Back then, I was self-learning SEO, email marketing, and copywriting before joining my first agency. I got deep into paid social performance marketing. Today, I enjoy turning data into actionable insights from acquisition to referral. <br></p>

  			<p class="experiments">	🧪 I enjoy running personal experiments. 
  			<ul>
  				<li>This website was built on day eight of my three month experiment on learning code. Track my daily progress <a class="here" href="https://twitter.com/emilyhlai/status/1263547451048439811">here.</a> <em> *This website updates often as I learn!</em></li>

  				<li>I once tried a <a class="here" href="https://twitter.com/emilyhlai/status/1229215899053367296">five day water fast.</a></li>
  				<li> I did an isolation float tank an hour a day for seven days straight.</li>
  				<li> Waking up with my phone turned off allows me to go into flow more easily.</li>
          <li> Low-carb intermittent fasting with no processed food is my winning diet.</li>
  				<li>My deep sleep increased by 44% with magnesium, sunshine, and movement. </li>
  			</ul>
